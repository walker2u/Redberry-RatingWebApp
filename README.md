1. rating app - goto /uploads to upload images.
2. every day on new image will be shown to all the users, and user can comment on it, as well as rate.
3. from now, we have upload part, in future, will implement a way to get image from the instagram accounts.


P.S :- The frontend is very lame, so please provide me with one, if you have.
